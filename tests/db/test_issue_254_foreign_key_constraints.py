"""Test to verify that issue #254 is fixed.

Issue #254: Foreign key constraint failures when deleting projects with related entities.

The issue was that when migration 647e7a75e2cd recreated the project table,
it did not re-establish the foreign key constraint from entity.project_id to project.id
with CASCADE DELETE, causing foreign key constraint failures when trying to delete
projects that have related entities.

Migration a1b2c3d4e5f6 was created to fix this by adding the missing foreign key
constraint with CASCADE DELETE behavior.

This test file verifies that the fix works correctly in production databases
that have had the migration applied.
