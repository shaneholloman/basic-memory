"""Tests for incremental scan watermark optimization (Phase 1.5).

These tests verify the scan watermark feature that dramatically improves sync
performance on large projects by:
- Using find -newermt for incremental scans (only changed files)
- Tracking last_scan_timestamp and last_file_count
- Falling back to full scan when deletions detected

Expected performance improvements:
- No changes: 225x faster (2s vs 450s for 1,460 files)
- Few changes: 84x faster (5s vs 420s)
