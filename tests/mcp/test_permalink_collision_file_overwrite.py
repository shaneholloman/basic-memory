"""Tests for permalink collision file overwrite bug discovered in live testing.

This test reproduces a critical data loss bug where creating notes with
titles that normalize to different permalinks but resolve to the same
file location causes silent file overwrites without warning.

Related to GitHub Issue #139 but tests a different aspect - not database
UNIQUE constraints, but actual file overwrite behavior.

Example scenario from live testing:
1. Create "Node A" → file: edge-cases/Node A.md, permalink: edge-cases/node-a
2. Create "Node C" → file: edge-cases/Node C.md, permalink: edge-cases/node-c
3. BUG: Node C creation overwrites edge-cases/Node A.md file content
4. Result: File "Node A.md" exists but contains "Node C" content
