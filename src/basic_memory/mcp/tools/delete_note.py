            1. **Already deleted**: The note may have been deleted previously
            2. **Wrong identifier**: The identifier format might be incorrect
            3. **Different project**: The note might be in a different project

            1. **Search for the note**: Use `search_notes("{project}", "{search_term}")` to find it
            2. **Try different formats**:
               - If you used a permalink like "folder/note-title", try just the title: "{title_format}"
               - If you used a title, try the permalink format: "{permalink_format}"

            3. **Check if already deleted**: Use `list_directory("/")` to see what notes exist
            4. **List notes in project**: Use `list_directory("/")` to see what notes exist in the current project

## Alternative actions:
- List available projects: `list_memory_projects()`

## Steps to resolve:
1. **Try again**: Wait a moment and retry the deletion

## General troubleshooting:
1. **Verify the note exists**: `read_note("{project}", "{identifier}")` or `search_notes("{project}", "{identifier}")`
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure you can edit/delete files in this project
3. **Try again**: The error might be temporary
4. **Check project**: Make sure you're in the correct project

## Step-by-step approach:
```
# 1. Confirm note exists and get correct identifier
search_notes("{project}", "{identifier}")

# 2. Read the note to verify access
read_note("{project}", "correct-identifier-from-search")

# 3. Try deletion with correct identifier
delete_note("{project}", "correct-identifier-from-search")
```

## Alternative approaches:
- Check what notes exist: `list_directory("{project}", "/")`

    """Delete a note or directory from the knowledge base.

    Permanently removes a note or directory from the specified project. For single notes,
    they are identified by title or permalink. For directories, use is_directory=True and
    provide the directory path. If the note/directory doesn't exist, the operation returns
    False without error. If deletion fails, helpful error messages are provided.

    Project Resolution:
    Server resolves projects in this order: Single Project Mode → project parameter → default project.
    If project unknown, use list_memory_projects() or recent_activity() first.

    Args:
        identifier: For files: note title or permalink to delete.
                   For directories: the directory path (e.g., "docs", "projects/2025").
                   Can be a title like "Meeting Notes" or permalink like "notes/meeting-notes"
        is_directory: If True, deletes an entire directory and all its contents.
                     When True, identifier should be a directory path
                     (without file extensions). Defaults to False.
        project: Project name to delete from. Optional - server will resolve using hierarchy.
                If unknown, use list_memory_projects() to discover available projects.
        output_format: "text" preserves existing behavior (bool/string). "json"
            returns machine-readable deletion metadata.
        context: Optional FastMCP context for performance caching.

    Returns:
        True if note was successfully deleted, False if note was not found.
        For directories, returns a formatted summary of deleted files.
        On errors, returns a formatted string with helpful troubleshooting guidance.

    Examples:
        # Delete by title
        delete_note("Meeting Notes: Project Planning")

        # Delete by permalink
        delete_note("notes/project-planning")

        delete_note("docs", is_directory=True)

        # Delete nested directory
        delete_note("projects/2024", is_directory=True)

        # Common usage pattern
        if delete_note("old-draft"):
